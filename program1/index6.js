curr_num= 0;
sum=0;
previous_sum = 0;

let n =4;
curr_num <4; (which is true 0 < 4)
previous_sum = sum; (which is 0 = 0)
sum =curr_num + previous_num(which is 0= 0 + 0)
curr-num = current_num + 1(which is 0 = 0 +1)

so curr_num =1;

like that we run that loop till 4 we get current_num = 5
and that is > than n(5>n) so we get false loop stop.
it print the sum which is 5.
